# 🔐 Finance App Compliance & Security

## ✅ Why AWS Cognito for OAuth (Finance App Requirement)

For **finance applications**, **ALL OAuth flows MUST go through AWS Cognito** to ensure compliance and security.

### 🛡️ Compliance Benefits

1. **SOC 2 Type II Compliance**
   - AWS Cognito is SOC 2 certified
   - Automated audit trails
   - Risk management controls

2. **ISO 27001 Compliance**
   - Information security management
   - Regular security audits
   - Data protection standards

3. **PCI DSS Compliance** (if handling payments)
   - Secure credential storage
   - Tokenization support
   - Audit logging

4. **HIPAA Compliance** (if healthcare finance)
   - PHI protection
   - Encrypted data transmission
   - Access controls

## 🏗️ Architecture: Better Auth → Cognito → OAuth Providers

```
User → Better Auth → Cognito Hosted UI → Google/GitHub → Cognito → Better Auth → User Session
```

### Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Better Auth redirects to **Cognito Hosted UI**
3. Cognito Hosted UI handles Google/GitHub OAuth
4. Cognito receives OAuth tokens
5. Cognito issues JWT tokens (ID, Access, Refresh)
6. Better Auth manages session with Cognito tokens
7. User is authenticated

## 🔒 Security Benefits

### 1. **Centralized Authentication**
- All auth flows go through Cognito
- Single point of control
- Consistent security policies

### 2. **Audit Trails**
- **CloudTrail Integration**: All auth events logged
- **User activity tracking**: Login attempts, failures, successes
- **Compliance reporting**: Ready for audits

### 3. **Secret Management**
- OAuth secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- No secrets in application code
- Automatic rotation support

### 4. **Token Security**
- Cognito issues secure JWT tokens
- Token expiration and refresh handled
- Secure token storage

### 5. **Advanced Security Features**
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**
- **Risk-based authentication**
- **Account lockout policies**
- **Password policies** (complexity, rotation)
- **Device tracking**

## 🚫 Why NOT Direct OAuth (for Finance Apps)

### ❌ Security Risks:
1. **No centralized audit trail**
   - Harder to track OAuth events
   - Compliance gaps

2. **Secret management in application**
   - OAuth secrets in `.env` files
   - Risk of accidental exposure

3. **No enterprise controls**
   - Missing MFA policies
   - Limited access controls

4. **Compliance gaps**
   - May not meet SOC 2/ISO requirements
   - Audit trail incomplete

5. **Token management complexity**
   - Manual token refresh handling
   - Security vulnerabilities

## ✅ Current Configuration

### OAuth Flow:
- ✅ **Google OAuth** → Configured in Cognito (built-in provider)
- ✅ **GitHub OAuth** → Configured in Cognito (OIDC provider)
- ✅ **All flows** → Go through Cognito Hosted UI

### Better Auth:
- ✅ **Cognito provider only** → No direct OAuth
- ✅ **Session management** → Uses Cognito tokens
- ✅ **User data** → Stored in database with Cognito user IDs

## 📋 Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Cognito (REQUIRED for OAuth)
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_XXXXXXXXX
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
COGNITO_DOMAIN=authly-default

# OAuth Provider Credentials (for Cognito configuration)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-secret
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-secret
```

**Note**: Google/GitHub credentials are used by **Cognito**, not directly by Better Auth.
