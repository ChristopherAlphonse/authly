# Cleanup Instructions

## Manual Steps Required

### 1. Delete the Go API Directory

Please manually delete the `api/` directory:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force api
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
rmdir /s /q api
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
rm -rf api
```

### 2. Verify Cleanup

After deleting the `api/` directory, verify the project structure:

```bash
# Should not show api/ directory
ls -la
```

### 3. Test the Application

```bash
# Test build
yarn build

# Test dev server
yarn dev
```

## What Was Removed

✅ Deleted Files:
- `app/src/lib/go-api-client.ts`
- `app/src/lib/go-api-client-axios.ts`
- `app/src/components/go-api-test.tsx`
- `app/src/components/go-api-test-axios.tsx`
- `app/src/app/api/[...path]/route.ts`

✅ Updated Files:
- `package.json` - Removed Go-related scripts and concurrently dependency
- `README.md` - Removed all Go mentions
- `app/src/constant/app_constants.ts` - Removed GO_API_DEFAULT_URL
- `vercel.json` - Updated for Next.js only deployment
- `.gitignore` - Removed Go build artifact patterns

## Remaining Steps

The `api/` directory still needs to be manually deleted. Please run the command above for your operating system.

After deletion, the project will be a clean Next.js-only application ready for Vercel deployment!
